# Security Policy

We consider the security of Sniffnet a top priority.<br>
The application is developed with a **security-first approach**:
it has always been designed to **protect users' data privacy and system integrity**,
as demonstrated by [security audits](https://sniffnet.net/news/security-audit/) assessing the application safety.

But no matter how much effort we put into securing the app, there can still be **vulnerabilities** present.

What we promise:

- We will respond to your report within 3 business days with our evaluation of the report and an expected resolution date
- If you have followed the instructions above, we will not take any legal action against you in regard to the report
- We will handle your report with strict confidentiality, and not pass on your personal details to third parties without your permission
- We will keep you informed of the progress towards resolving the problem

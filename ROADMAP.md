# Roadmap

The <a href="https://whimsical.com/Damodrdfx22V9jGnpHSCGo">Sniffnet Roadmap</a> aims to provide a visual overview of the direction the project is heading.<br>
It includes the most relevant features implemented since Sniffnet 1.0, and other significant milestones that are planned for the future. <br>

The ultimate goal is to come up with **Sniffnet 2.0**: a feature-wise complete network monitoring-and-management tool,
built having in mind the most requested features by its users during the years, 
and embodying the final step of the transition from a personal toy-project to one of the most renowned network analysers available.
